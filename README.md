MoveApps

Github repository: *https://github.com/dmpstats/moveapps-check-parallel*

## Description
A simplistic example App to test and evaluate the use of parallel processing in the MoveApps system.

## Documentation
The sole purpose of this App is to provide a test-case for the implementation of parallel processing within the MoveApps framework. Specifically. parallelization is done via the `R` package `furrr`, which offers map-like functions to distribute and run tasks in parallel.
