# Test Parallel Processing

MoveApps

Github repository: *https://github.com/dmpstats/moveapps-check-parallel*

## Description
An example App to test and evaluate the use of parallel processing in the MoveApps system.

## Documentation
The sole purpose of this App is to provide a simple test-case for demonstrating parallel processing within the MoveApps framework. Parallelization is set via the excellent `R` package [`{furrr}`](https://furrr.futureverse.org/index.html), which offers map-like functions to distribute and run tasks in parallel.
